### Identifying Artists in Fine Art Paintings

Goals:

- Compare performance of classical models like SVMs & Random Forests to CNNs.
- Observe the performance of transfer learning from one painting style like Impressionism to another, like New Realism or 
Early Renaissance. 
- Learn to implement simple deep learning architectures in Keras and PyTorch.
